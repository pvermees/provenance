Description: Bundles a number of established statistical methods to facilitate the visual interpretation of large datasets in sedimentary geology. Includes functionality for adaptive kernel density estimation, multidimensional scaling, generalised procrustes analysis and individual differences scaling using a variety of dissimilarity measures. Univariate provenance proxies, such as single-grain ages or (isotopic) compositions are compared with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Kuiper or Sircombe-Hazelton L2 distances. Categorical provenance proxies, such as mineralogical, petrographic or chemical compositions are compared with the Aitchison and Bray-Curtis distances. Also included are tools to plot compositional data on ternary diagrams, to calculate the sample size required for specified levels of statistical precision, and to assess the effects of hydraulic sorting on detrital compositions. Includes an intuitive query-based user interface for users who are not proficient in R.
