\title{Read a .csv file with compositional data}
\usage{
read.compositional(fname, method = NULL, colmap = "rainbow")
}
\arguments{
\item{fname}{a string with the path to the .csv file}

\item{method}{either "bray" (for the Bray-Curtis distance) or
"aitchison" (for Aitchison's central logratio distance). If
omitted, the function defaults to 'aitchison', unless there are
zeros present in the data.}

\item{colmap}{an optional string with the name of one of R's
built-in colour palettes (e.g., heat.colors, terrain.colors,
topo.colors, cm.colors), which are to be used for plotting the
data.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{compositional}, i.e. a list with
    the following items:

\code{x}: a data frame with the samples as rows and the categories as columns

\code{method}: either "aitchison" (for Aitchison's centred logratio
distance) or "bray" (for the Bray-Curtis distance)

\code{colmap}: the colour map provided by the input argument
}
\description{
Reads a data table containing compositional data (e.g. chemical
concentrations)
}
\examples{
    fname <- system.file("Major.csv",package="provenance")
    Major <- read.compositional(fname)
    plot(PCA(Major))
}
